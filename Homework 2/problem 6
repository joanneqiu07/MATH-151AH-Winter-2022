Problem 6. Write code that implements the following algorithms for solving linear systems itearatively: 
   Jacobi’s method, the Gauss-Seidel method and the Successive Over Relaxation method.
1. Use all three to solve the linear system Ax⋆ = b where A and b are given below.
   Make a plot of the logarithm of the errors, log(∥xk −x⋆∥2) (you may use the fact
   x⋆ = [1 2 3 4] against the number of iterations (for all three methods).
2. Experiment with different values of the parameter ω in the SOR method. Are there
any values for which the method doesn’t converge?
