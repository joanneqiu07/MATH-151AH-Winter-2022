Problem 4. Implement the composite Simpson’s rule and use it to evaluate the following definite integrals, using the indicated value of m.

Problem 5. The fourth Legendre polynomial is Q4(x) = x4 − 6x2 + 3 . 7 35
1. Use a root-finding algorithm of your choice to approximate the Gaussian quadrature nodes x1, x2, x3 and x4 by approximating the roots of Q4(x). 
   Hint: You might want to use the fol lowing initializations for your root-finding schemes: −0.9, −0.3, 0.3 and 0.9. 
   Also, you can use a built-in root-finding algorithm in Matlab or Python; you don’t need to code your own.
2. Now, determine the corresponding weights α1, α2, α3 and α4.
3. Using the Gaussian quadrature points and weights computed in parts (a) and (b), implement 4 point Gaussian quadrature. 
   Use it to evaluate the same three definite integrals as in Question 4.
